# Mr. Tambourine Markov Man

**Markov Chain Generated Dylan Lyrics**

_Too Gospel Years if you ask me..._

> But among the dead angels that they could not reach, Could I been to you.
>
> When He rose from the dead, did they know?
> 
> Hmm, when my life down in your arms and carries him to the tomb, My soul flew to mansions on high.
> 
> When He spoke to them in the night?
> 
> The tuxedo that youâ€™re trying to break this date.
> 
> Well, ya never miss you water till your well runs dry Come one, baby, give our love a try, let's stick together You know, the streets are filled with gold As if it was a gambler, Lord, down in the wind Who's a-gonna kiss your Menphis lips When I'm out in the city, did they see?
> 
> Lord, you shouldn't mistreat me, baby, a casual look will do Just what do you know she soothed my mind, boys, She rocked me kinda slow and easy All day and I'll be in Santa Fe about one Billy, you've been away I lose a little black tick.
> 
> Oh, what did you expect?
> 
> No, no, babe, I got two white horses following me And there's two white horses following me And there's two white horses following me And you willingly surrender to me, baby Where I live here, baby, Lord, and feel at ease?
> 
> To preach of peace and brotherhood Oh, what are you ready?
